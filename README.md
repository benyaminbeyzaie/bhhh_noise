## Project Details

This project is a Flutter-based replica of [shhhnoise.com](https://www.shhhnoise.com/), adopting the BLoC pattern for state management and following a semi-clean architecture for code organization.

To customize the available noises, simply modify the `staticNoisePlayMap` within the `repository/noise_player_model.dart` file. (Note: In the future, we intend to relocate the static noise definitions to a separate JSON file.) Keep in mind that the current noise selections are randomized and may not be ideal for mixing.

We welcome contributions! Feel free to participate in the project and help us make it even better.
