## Details

This project is basically a clone of https://www.shhhnoise.com/ in flutter. I've used BLoC for state management and a semi-clean-architecture is used for code architecture.

Changing the noises is very simple you just have to change `staticNoisePlayMap` in `repository/noise_player_model.dart` file (I should make another separated json file for static noise detail later!). Current noises are totally random and maybe not even good for mixing!

Feel free to contribute.
