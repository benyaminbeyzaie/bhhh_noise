## Project Details

This project is a Flutter-based clone of [shhhnoise.com](https://www.shhhnoise.com/). It utilizes the BLoC pattern for state management and follows a semi-clean architecture for code organization.

To change the noises, simply modify the `staticNoisePlayMap` in the `repository/noise_player_model.dart` file. (Note: In the future, I plan to move the static noise details to a separate JSON file.) The current noises are randomly selected and may not be optimal for mixing.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to contribute to the project and make it even better.
